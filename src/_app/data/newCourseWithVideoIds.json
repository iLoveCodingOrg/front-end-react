In this course you will go from a complete newbie knowing nothing about programming or JavaScript for that matter to becoming comfortable in building real-world apps; And understanding each line of code that you actually write.</p><p>Now before I go further I want to say good job on choosing JavaScript as a programming language to learn. You may already know that JavaScript is the world's most versatile programming language - meaning you can do more things with JavaScript than any other programming language.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">JavaScript is used to build web applications, website APIs, backend, front-end, user interfaces for TV's, mobile apps, websites </span>and<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\"> even airport terminal applications. In fact, I was one of the programmers who built the United Airlines airport terminal application with JavaScript. </span>Well<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\"> that's a story for another day, but the fact of the matter is you have made a wise choice to learning JavaScript. It's going to serve you well in your career </span>now,<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\"> and in the long run.</span></p><p><b>Now let's see what you will be learning in this course:</b></p><p>There are only three goals for this course.</p><p>Firstly, have you learn the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p><p>Secondly, have you start thinking like a software engineer.</p><p>And thirdly, have you start building real-world apps - Someone who can think logically on how to break down problems into logical chunks and build something useful piece by piece.</p><p>When learning how to code and there are a few challenges that people encounter. One of the biggest challenges is that programming has a lot of complex words like closure, lexical scope, boolean, array, function, constructor, scope, operators, coercion, public and private functions, and so much more.</p><p>Now the thing is that all of these terms look complicated, sound complicated, but if understood simply they're very basic and simple. That's where this course shines. I will not only teach you how to code but I will expose you with these words so you understand them and even start talking like a developer.</p><p>The second place where this course shines is that I explain to you things simply. I use easy to understand words and I do not make assumptions that you'll have previous knowledge of other concepts. So everything I teach in this course starts from the baseline and I build your knowledge one lesson at a time until you fully understand all the major concepts.</p><p>The third and very important reason why this course will help you better is that I always give you practical examples on when and how to apply your knowledge to build real-world solutions. Many books, blogs, bootcamps, and lectures just go on in the technical conceptual side. In this course, you will learn not just the conceptual side of things but also the practical side on everything you learn. When you tie your learning with examples and real use-cases, your knowledge will actually sink in on a deeper level and you'll be able to become a much better developer in the end.</p><p>In this course, we will focus on building a solid foundation of JavaScript. So in the future when you are learning additional technologies your learning will be much more smoother because you have a solid foundation.</p><p>In this course. You will learn:</p><p></p><ul><li>What is JavaScript and how it's different than other programming languages.</li>\n    <li>What are the basic types in JavaScript and how to use them.</li>\n    <li><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">How to use JavaScript to build </span>a website<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\"> interfaces and backend server-side applications with node.js.</span></li>\n    <li>How to create simple and complex objects to structure your application.</li>\n    <li>How to use functions and scope to control the flow of your application.</li>\n    <li>How to use the new features of JavaScript like the \"spread operator\", \"const\", \"let\", \"promise\" and much more.</li>\n    <li>We will learn the advanced concepts of \"closure\", the \"this\" keyword and really understand them at a very core level, so you are actually a good developer.</li>\n    <li>We will learn about the DOM and how to use vanilla JavaScript to build apps.</li>\n    <li>We will learn about events and how JavaScript is a single-threaded environment and still extremely fast and performant.<br><br>Ther<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">e is a reason why PayPal, Uber, LinkedIn, and many other companies are using JavaScript to build their apps</span>.</li>\n    <li>We will learn about \"arrow function\", \"coercion\", \"event loop\" and so much more.</li>\n    <li>You will learn about how to debug your applications and understand the error messages that you see on the screen.</li>\n    <li>You see errors and bugs are common. No app is created without having errors.<br><br>So most new developers think that bugs are bad, but actually,<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\"> they're not. Having bugs or error messages is a normal process in a developers life.</span></li></ul><p></p><p>So I will make you comfortable that when you see a bug or an error message you're very comfortable in seeing what it is recognizing it and then fixing the problem. This is just the normal flow of a developers life.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't iPhone have bugs? Doesn't Microsoft products have bugs? They are the technology giants. They build technologies so it's a great realization for us to have that bugs are normal. It's our job as a developer to understand these errors and earn how to fix them. I will also show you how to use the dev tools built inside Google Chrome to troubleshoot your apps and resolve bugs.</p><p>You will learn how to connect your apps with third-party API and get information from them and use it in your apps. Now keep in mind all these complicated words that I've used so far, you will understand all of them because I will take you piece by piece and explain them all to you. I will give you a cheat sheets homework and examples along the way so you understand all of the concepts.</p><p>Along the way you will build a few apps like a \"todo list app\", a \"clock app\" a \"Tap feature\" so you understand things at its core and how to apply these concepts.</p><p>Just so this course does not become overly long, you will find a lot of practice projects lessons outside of this course. So in the member's area often of coding so you get a ton of practice on building things and applying your knowledge.</p><p>Imagine you finally conquering your fear of coding. Imagine you are finally thinking and building like a software engineer. Imagine your starting or enhancing your career as a software engineer. And imagine finally that your understanding JavaScript at its core and understanding what you see on the screen and building real-world stuff.</p><p>If all this excites you, let's get started.</p>\n<p></p>",

Software development or programming or software engineering means the same thing. So when a lot of bootcamps or courses are saying hey learn how to code learn how to code become job ready. They're actually not telling you upfront what area of development you are going to be led into. They may be telling that to you but if you have a clear picture that they're actually nine main areas of software development you will be able to make informed decision on which path you want to take.</p><p>So in this video I'm going to share with you the nine areas which ones are more popular which ones are not and which one is a better more successful more profitable career, more promising career I should say for you for other people out there. So let's get started.<br></p><h3>#1: Language/Compilers Developers</h3><p>So the first area of development is actually a language or compiler developer. So these kind of developers are like linguists of the programming world. They actually build programming languages. They work with low-level programming languages and machine languages to build newer programming languages. So these account for about 1 percent of developers only 1 percent of developers actually create programming languages.</p><h3>#2: Embedded Systems Developers</h3><p>Now the next type is actually called embedded systems and developer they account for about 3 percent of developers. So embedded system developers program or write code that actually run on hardware.</p><p>So imagine your car your fridge or your washing machine or electronic toys. They have some kind of code on them. That's why when you actually click a button something happens; the fridge knows how to regulate the temperature; your car knows how to turn on, turn off, accelerate, decelerate, the car stereo electronics all of this is programmed and the embedded-system developer actually codes that program to tell the machine what needs to be done. And by the way just a side-topic, a developer is somebody who actually writes code to talk to a computer tell the computer what to do. So there are different kinds of developers who actually tell different kinds of computers on what to do.</p><p>A language and compiler developers actually create programming languages embedded systems developer. As I told you right now code on these particular hardware.</p><h3>#3: Operating System Developers</h3><p>Next in line is operating system developers. These are actually developers who actually write the operating system software. So let's say a Windows developer, Android, the people who actually made Android, Mac OS, Linux, Unix, these are the developers who actually made these operating systems and continue to improve them.</p><h3>#4: Data Scientists</h3><p>Then there are data scientist. There is all this craze about data science artificial intelligence and all of this right. They account for about 7% of developers. So now you may be imagining or thinking what does a data scientist do what kind of programs do they write. So actually data scientists are more like mathematicians and statisticians that actually code.</p><p>So a data scientist does not code a software per in the typical sense. They actually write program. They actually write code that actually work on mathematical and statistical models to predict or forecast what's going to happen. So let's say our typical data scientist will actually be given a lot of data. So maybe a lot of words or maybe a lot of stats or a lot of pricing information whatever the company is doing. They're gonna be given a lot of data and they will actually write this mathematical and statistical model that's going to forecast what that information means or could happen. So that's what they're doing, they're actually not creating user interfaces or typical softwares in the typical sense.</p><h3>#5: Video Game Developers</h3><p>Then there are video game developers these are developers who actually write the video games that we play on our console or on our computer. They account for about 8% of developers.</p><h3>#6: Dev Ops Developers</h3><p>Then we have dev ops developers. Now that's a new term these days. So dev ops stands for development and operations engineers. So they used to be actually called system administrators previously so dev-ops job is to manage and maintain computer infrastructure and servers of a company. So dev-ops do not actually make software in the typical sentence. They actually don't make mobile apps or web apps or those kind of things. They actually write code to manage and automate the servers that they are working on so those are dev ops.</p><h3>#7: Desktop Developers</h3><p>Then we have desktop developers. So these are developers who actually make desktop applications like your Microsoft Excel, Adobe Photoshop, Paint, Safari browser and other desktop applications are built by such developers. They may specialize in a particular operating system so they may specialize in a Linux desktop application or Windows desktop application, Mac desktop application or all of them. So depends on their expertise but desktop application developers will make a desktop application.</p><h3>#8: Mobile Apps Developers</h3><p>Then we have mobile apps developers. These are 20% of developers so mobile apps developers of course will make your banking application your workout application for your phone or a map application and other applications that we enjoy on our Android devices or on our iOS devices. Right. So these developers may specialize in one or other or both of these platforms so maybe an android IOS or both. Right!</p><h3>#9: Web Developers</h3><p>Now the last piece and the biggest piece is actually web app developers. So these are the people who actually code your Facebook.coms or your Google.com or your Amazon.com or your Netflix.com. Any of these dot coms or dot nets are dot org. iLoveCoding.org will be created by the web app developer.</p><p>Now previously these kind of developers were only called web developers or web developers but nowadays since the world is enhancing and progressing and development, the web application development has been broken down into two parts. So one is the one part is actually called a <b>front-end developer</b> and the other part is actually called a <b>backend developer</b>.<br></p><p>So the difference in a backend application or a front-end application or a front-end developer and a backend developer is actually a front-end application developer would actually make the user interface of a website. So let's say if you are working for you know Facebook.com or Google.com let's just go with Google. So a Google firm developer would actually make the look and feel of the entire website and also the functionality and the features of the Web site. So, for instance, let's say when you start typing inside Google it automatically shows you suggestions. Right. So that kind of feature will be created by a front-end developer, right. so the user interface is actually called the front-end. So a frontier developer would create that. Now the job of the backend developer on the other hand would be let's say when you are actually typing in some information on Google let's say, that information is actually sent to the backend system that the user doesn't see but that is the. That is the layer that's the application which actually powers the information to the front-end. So let's say when you Google something the information is actually stored your search results are actually stored in the Google database. So the information from the front-end whatever the user does is sent to the back end. The backend actually says oh the user search for this information I'm going to go look in the database and then give the result to the user. So the back end developer would actually work with the data find information processed the information make sure that information is secure and then pass that information to the front-end. So the user can see the front-end application will actually show the user and phase the back and application will manage the data and security of the data.<br></p><p>So both of these parts together actually make a web application. And now the new word for this is people who actually know both of these things are actually called full-stack developer. Front-end + backend is actually a full-stack developer previously five days five years ago these words were not existent they were actually just called web developers but these are the new specialties and that's called it virtual have been introduced.</p><p>So these are the nine types of software developers now a natural question that you may have is OK. There is there are nine areas which one should I become. This one is the most profitable most promising for my future. So let's answer that question in the next video but at least you have this big picture on the nine main areas in which are the areas where more most of the development happens. So 35% of development happens in the web, 20 % in Mobile, 12% in desktop, 11% in Dev-ops and so forth. So that's pretty much it for this video. I'm going to talk to you in the next lesson.</p>"

So if you are interested in making video games you go become a video game developer. If you are interested in mathematics, statistics and you like to work with data to predict or forecast the future - artificial intelligence then you go become a data scientist. Same with web apps mobile apps desktop apps or any other area.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">Now if you are kind of neutral then I have certain suggestions for you that's going to increase your chances of success.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">So that natural answer is that you want to become a web developer because there is more opportunity and there is more work and more scope of work in the market for a web developer than any other kind of developer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">So let me just make that case. So let's say there are so many companies in the world. There is a video game company right. Does the video game company have a website? Yes they do. So they need a web developer.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">A data science company. Do they need a website? Yes they do, so they need a web developer. Operating system companies, embedded system companies, dev-ops companies, desktop app companies, mobile app companies, do they need a website? In most cases, 99% of the chances are that all the companies in the world need a website and hence there is a need for a web developer. So that is why there is more work. There is 35% of the work happening in the web app department and there's more work and more opportunity and more jobs out there for web development.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">That's why the safest and the most long term and lucrative part of a development area is web development. In fact, a lot of the desktop apps, and the mobile apps, actually rely on the Internet. So let's say if you're talking about a slack application or the Skype application or the mobile app for let's say Instagram or Facebook mobile app they actually need data from the Internet. So actually they need a web developer to power that data which is a backend developer.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">So all of this most of the companies need the Internet and internet is mostly programmed by a backend developer, a web developer. So the safest answer is that you want to become a web developer.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">Now if you are listening to my videos that's great because my specialty is actually web app development and a little bit of mobile, desktop, and dev-ops as well. I do not know anything about video games data science operating systems embedded systems or language. So this is not my expertise but if you are interested in making web applications, mobile application, desktop applications and becoming a modern developer then I can assist you because I've worked for United Airlines, CVS Health, Uptake and in some other companies and launched my own companies as well. And I know that on how all of that side of the world works.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">So the next natural question you may have is OK. You know Aziz I'm going to listen to you maybe web development is the most safest answer for me. Now what should I do? So for that let's go to the next video where I have a complete Skill Roadmap on each skill that you need to acquire. So you become job-ready, interview-ready and portfolio-ready - So you are a proficient and confident web developer. So let me talk to you in the next video.</span></p>"

So, for instance, when you are let's say an embedded systems developer that a programming language which is used to perform that particular task is either a C programming language or C++ or Java Python or JavaScript. These are some popular languages. Of course, there could be one or the other or a combination of some but it depends on the company you work for, which tools they choose. So it's not to say that one programming language is better than the other is just that certain programming languages because they are created they actually are used and become kind of specialized in certain areas of development.</span><br></p><p>So remember we were talking about that the most promising area of software development is actually the web application development. So for web application development you will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a front-end applications and for back and applications depending on the company you work for you could be using Java C#, PHP, Python, JavaScript. So it depends on which company chooses which particular tool.</p><p>So one thing you will notice I've created another chart that a Web site application consists of two parts right. So let's say it's a front-end application and a backend application. And one thing you will notice that JavaScript is the only programming language that can be used in the front-end and actually in the backend as well. So let's say a front-end application which is the user interface will always always always be using HTML CSS and JavaScript. So if you if you think about it a browser is the environment in which a website exists, a front-end exist, browser is the only environment right. So browsers only support JavaScript programming language so that is the reason why all the websites of the world if they are a little bit fancy and popular they have to and must and they do use JavaScript to create their front end applications.</p><p>Now as for the backend they have different options they could use PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, C#, Java. There are different options but all Web sites the front it is built with Asia multi SS and JavaScript so it makes it very clear that JavaScript is the language to learn.</p><p>If you're going to become a front-end application developer.</p><p>Now there's one very interesting thing which has been happening for the past five, six, seven years. That is that JavaScript has become the world's most versatile programming language. So what do I mean by that? So I've created another table for you. So JavaScript has become recent in the recent years so popular and so versatile and so capable that big and small companies are using JavaScript not just to create front-end applications but also back in applications, mobile applications, and even desktop applications. So these are the list of some of the companies which are using JavaScript in a big way to create their major applications. So think about the Facebook mobile app, Instagram mobile app, Uber mobile app, Skype mobile app, Slack desktop app, Skype WhatsApp, PayPal, Uber you know they are all using JavaScript for their major applications not like a small mini fun project that they have; major applications.</p><p>So if you think about thing about this particular chart of the nine areas of software development, JavaScript is the only programming language that is used in front-end. Right. We know that which I just told you in this video but JavaScript is also the only language which can be used in front and backend, mobile, desktop development and now it is it's been used for video game development and data science as well. It's not as popular in data science and video games as much. There are other languages that rule that particular space but it has become a major player in the web world mobile world and desktop world.</p><p>So that leads you to ask the question there. OK. That's pretty clear in that JavaScript is the world's most versatile programming language. It can enable me to do far more much more things. And it will give me far much better scope in my career now and in the future because a lot of companies are using it. It just gives me bigger and bigger pool of doing stuff and the job opportunities so that's pretty clear.</p><p>Now the next step you want to determine. OK. JavaScript is a clear winner. But then what are the specific things I learned within JavaScript. What are the specific supporting technologies around JavaScript and what are the exact tools and resources and roadmap? What is my roadmap that I need? What do I do, so I become a job-ready JavaScript developer? and that we will discuss in the next video where I'm going to show you that exact path. So talk to you in the next lesson.</p>"

So you are able to work in the workplace. So here is the chart that I've created for you. So it is a chart that has the skills and it has the timeline. So you already know by now that a front end developer is somebody who creates modern user interfaces for the web. So, what are the tools. What are the skills needed by a front-end developer. A front-end developer needs first and foremost to know how HTML and CSS work. Now HTML and CSS are not programming languages, they are coding languages but they are not programming languages. The difference is that a programming language would have some logical aspect of it. So let's say determining the logical flow, telling the computer if this happens do something do that. If a different situation happens do something else. So that's the logical instructional piece that a computer needs; And HTML and CSS have nothing to do with that, they have nothing to do with the logical aspect. HTML is a language that is used to make the skeleton off the websites and CSS is instruction style of writing code which is not logic but it's just a sheet of instructions that add color and advanced layout to a web page. So it's really the look and feel is determined by HTML and CSS.</p><p>So if you're going to make simple web sites you need to know HTML and CSS and iLoveCoding has a very comprehensive free course very detailed which cheatsheets and homeworks of how to learn HTML and CSS and make professional looking websites. Now once you know that that's the important piece you can not skip that piece it's important right. That issue once he has his course is better than many college level and paid courses and bootcamp courses there are people charging a thousand dollars for certain training and this course will give you that training, and it's free. You can check it out. It's you can check it out and you'll find it for yourself.</p><p>So once you have that particular training which is going to be very fast it's not a complicated subject but it has certain certain things that you need to learn. So after you know that then you're going to get into the programming phase and JavaScript as we have determined throughout your lessons that I've given you that JavaScript is the language for the web, and now language used in other areas as well.</p><p>So what you need to do is learn Javascript fundamentals so you know how programming works. You are able to think like a developer you are you are able to solve problems breakdown problem problems into logical pieces so you can build features for the web.</p><p>In our case so you learn JavaScript and then you learn how JavaScript is used in the browser. All right. So now you're using the layouts with HTML and CSS and you're using the functional aspect of JavaScript and working with the browser to actually create a modern user interfaces. So when you put these three pieces together HTML, CSS and&nbsp; JavaScript this. This combination will make you a front end developer because you're able to create these modern user interfaces. So once you know these three things you are job-ready, front-end developer of course you will have to create your portfolio items and put on your resume and you have to understand those concept concept and the nitty gritty details of Asian multi essence and JavaScript in a deep way. So you can answer those interview questions and iLoveCoding teaches you all of this. So it teaches you the details of let's say what a closure is very complicated looking bored but I make it simple so you can actually understand it and communicate it to your interview when those questions arises. So all of these concepts are covered in the JavaScript course and how the browser works and how DOM works.</p><p>Then since the world is becoming more modern and there are certain tools created in the in the world for enhancing the developer's ability to quickly create these applications there are many libraries created, so a library is a piece of software which kinda think of it like a power tool.</p><p>So that's like a hammer is a tool but let's say a drill machine is a power tool so it has certain features which can enhance the speed of a developer to do certain things. So a library is just a piece of software to speed up a developer job. So there is a very popular library out there called a React.js which is actually built on top of JavaScript HTML and CSS which actually makes it easy for developers to make modern applications. So I actually teach you in iLoveCoding these modern technologies as well so you don't just know the fundamentals which are extremely important. You can not skip the fundamentals you'll learn the fundamentals and then you learn the modern technologies which are relevant today. So you are more in-demand person in the marketplace so you can get your job quickly because these technologies are in demand today. So you're going to learn React.js and then the nitty gritty details and along the way over here it says \"core training\" and \"practice project\" so I give you the core details of the fundamentals and also I quickly translate those theories into practical projects. So you see OK. This is a complicated sounding word but it's not that complicated because explain it to you in a simple manner and then you apply that theory to you know all it's it's just oh it's it's called let's say \"prototype\" but it's just a simple property</p><p>That's what it is. Oh what is a method?, A method is just a function. What is a function? A function is just an instruction... of course I'm going to go I'm going to very quickly but explain these things in a simple manner throughout the course. So you know that the the theoretical bard and you know the practical part of it as well and that's the core, you can not just learn theory, you can and just when you were born your parents just do not give you instruction manual they actually showed you how things were done and that's how you learn through practice through actual application.</p><p>So when you know these these four areas HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals, working with browser and working with a library like React.js which is very popular you are a job-ready front-end developer of course at the same time you will have to build your portfolio which I'm going to help you at. You're going to be practicing for your interviews and you're going to work on your resume. So you are actually able to you just don't have your skills you're able to translate that skilled and communicate your skills to an employer. So you know the skills but you have to show that you have the skills to do that through a resume a portfolio and applying for jobs and answering those questions in the interview.</p><p>The next part after you are a front end developer then you can actually build on top of that knowledge and become a full-stack developer, and what does a full-stack developer have? a full-stack developer knows what front-end does, He's a front-end developer plus knows how a backend application works. So I'll back an application can be built with Node.js. So remember I told you that JavaScript is now able to be used to make back in applications. So there is an environment of JavaScript called Node.js. So you're simply using the jobs for programming language in the Node.js environment and you are now able to make backend applications as well. So I have courses for Node.js and Express.js which is again a framework for framework/library of JavaScript that enables you to create these backend applications as well so you can control the data layer and then whereas all the data stored is stored in a database. So I show you there is a course on JavaScript how to work with MongoDB which is a name of a database. So how do you use a mongoDB to store your data in an organized manner so you know how to make a full application the user interface layer the backend data layer and also the database layer so you these are the three pieces which actually make a fully functional application.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">Think about Google. There is a user interface; there is a backend layer and there is a data layer where all that information is actually stored. Any application called dot com Amazon.com. Any any application you think about. There are always these three layers. So once you know all these three layers you are a full-stack developer and that's what you learn. I've broken it down for you.</span><br></p><p>You learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals, working with DOM, modern libraries see your job-ready (React.js). You are going to be job-ready but is gonna be in demand so it's gonna be easy for you to get a job; Then you learn Node.js you learn Express.js for the data layer you learn MongoDB for the database then you're a full-stack developer.</p><p>Then you may say hey you know I want to make desktop applications and mobile applications as well, so remember I told you there are certain power tools that developers have created on top of JavaScript; So there is actually a library called Reactive-Native which when used which is power tool on top of JavaScript which when used will enable you to make mobile applications for Android and iOS as well. So I have a course on React Native where we actually create a cryptocurrency mobile app which you which you will enable you to learn how to use JavaScript and we need to actually launch mobile applications.</p><p>There is actually another framework out there called Electron which is a JavaScript framework so we're actually when you use JavaScript in combination with Electron you are able to make desktop applications.</p><p>So the Microsoft Editor application, the Atom Editor application, Slack desktop application, they're all built with Electron. So when I was talking about React Native, the Facebook mobile app, the Instagram mobile app, and I'm not sure about others but these mobile apps are actually built with a Reactive Native. So these are the tools which are used in the real world and they're all based on JavaScript. These these developers make these frameworks which enable you to actually build these applications and there is a course on each of this and more.</p><p>Now these are the big picture. This is the big picture roadmap and this is what you're gonna do with \"core training\" with \"practice projects\" you build your portfolio along the way you build your resume along the way you practice for your interviews along the way. So you become competent so that you are job-ready.</p><p>Now these are the big pictures but the many small topics along the way like</p><p><ul><li>What is an API?</li><li><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">How does a domain work?</span></li><li>How do you upload your website live?</li><li>How do you work with authentication?</li><li>How do you work with collaborating your code with Git and Github?</li></ul></p><p>So all these many topics are taught along the way so you don't just know the big picture but you also know these smaller topics which a developer needs to know, so you are competent and you're able to perform at your job. So that is the roadmap you need to follow. Of course you don't have to go all the way to the top. You can just go for your first start. You're gonna become a front-end developer because that's the baseline. So once you're ready and job-ready you apply for jobs you become a front end developer employed front-end developer but then you can keep on enhancing your skills and the learning never ends. You know even after five six seven eight nine ten years you're gonna be still learning and deepening your knowledge. But the foundation is there in iLoveCoding training so you are becoming job-ready and you're becoming productive, so when you have ideas to launch certain ideas in the world, web application mobile applications you can actually launch them because you have the skills. Of course it takes time but this is your roadmap.</p><p>So that's pretty much it for this video. I hope you have that clarity if you have any questions let me know and I'll talk to you in the next video.</p>"

Where do I learn it from? And in this video I'm going to explain the concept about how to go about effectively learning these skills. So that's the presentation we're gonna have today. So how do you really go about learning this really seemingly alien skill for writing code which is very weird. And then talking to a computer. So the answer to the question is the way you learn how to code is exactly the way you learn any particular skill.</p><p>Now when you were a child you copied your parents you copied your siblings you copied what you saw and that is the way you acquired skill. So coding is actually no different. Just to give you a solid example. A lot of authors who are trying to become authors like somebody else they aspire to become like they actually hand copy the writings of the author they want to become like they aspire to be like. So when they copy, hand-copy like a machine like a robot their writings they actually subconsciously ingest the pot processes the writing style of the big author.</p><p>They want to become like that's the exact way you're going to learn how to code. That's the exact way I learned how to code. That's the exact way I learned how to do graphic design. So what I would do is when I wanted to learn how to code when I would watch a particular video or tutorial video. I would actually copy and follow along the code. The program that the video was showing me. So when I teach at iLoveCoding. I will give you two things. I will give you the baseline background knowledge but then I will show you a practical example on how to apply that knowledge. So when I'm showing you those examples it's your job. That's my instruction to you that you copy along and follow along what I'm telling you, what I'm teaching you. So when you actually just mindlessly copy you're going to subconsciously digest and understand the concepts. And even when you're copying you're going to find some mistakes that you're making and that's going to internalize the concepts even further. So the first rule even though it's very simple is to copy and follow along just like any skill is acquired by copying.</p><p>The second thing which is very important and that's the reason why a lot of people struggle is that they have something called a \"shiny object syndrome\". What you need to do is ignore any media, any mainstream media, or any kind of information that's telling you hey learn jQuery or you don't learn jQuery or you got to learn these five things to become super genius and become job ready. All these blog articles people who are writing that's their business to write. That's how they make money. The number one technique of journalism and news is that they show you something new. Right. So when you see in the news there is something new out there. You go out and look at that information. But any successful company is successful or any successful individual is successful. Even you, you are successful in certain areas is because you stuck with the fundamentals, some baselines and that worked for you.</p><p>If you kept on chasing the new stuff the shiny stuff it wouldn't work for you, people would not progress. So ignore shiny objects ignored the tendency to chase after the new thing. It's not going to work for you.</p><p>The next thing which is kind of the same goes along with the \"shiny object syndrome\" is to stick with fundamentals first approach. What do I mean by that? What I really mean is when you are learning how to code there are certain concepts there are a lot of small mini concepts that's going to show up right. And when they show up don't just graze through it. Try to understand the core concepts and in iLoveCoding training I actually give you the the new concept in a fundamental way. So when you have a solid foundation when you go at the workplace when you're trying to make your programs you're going to be much more efficient at making those programs because you have the solid foundation. If you think about any particular sport let's say golfing any kind of sport all or mixed martial arts what they do is they actually repeatedly practice the fundamental moves of whether it be golfing or whatever sport they practice the moves the fundamental moves again and again so they never have to lose their foundation because all new techniques and skill is built on the foundation. So all these new libraries and frameworks and all these new stuff is out there is just new temporarily. The foundation is never going to go away so let's say bootstrap framework as new, React.js is new. It's very hot Vue.js is new, React.js is new, React Native is new. There's so many new stuff but all this new stuff is actually built on top of the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and JavaScript. So actually I released a course on HTML and CSS like 4 years ago and after four years the fundamentals remain the same and the course was doing pretty well unless I later released a version to just for better explanations. But the training and the concept remained the same because fundamentals tend to not change. So once you have a solid foundation you focus on the fundamentals. The way I teach you in iLoveCoding you're going to make your progress much more faster.</p><p>Learning technique number four quickly translate theory into real world use cases. So one of the things about learning is so difficult, learning how to code is so difficult is because they have this weird difficult looking, difficult sounding words, \"constructor\", \"prototype\", \"coercion\", \"closures\" right? All this weird sounding words that scare us. And the reason they scare us is because they look complicated they sound complicated but they're actually very simple if they are explained correctly to you and a lot of times they are not explained correctly because the teacher who is trying to teach us many at times, I'm just not happy to inform you and many times they don't even understand the concept themselves. Hence they are not able to translate the knowledge to you. That's just sad but that's true. I'm sorry to say that. So whenever you learn a new concept you take that concept you say okay. The new concept is always gonna be vague. Right. So when you translate that vague concept into a practical use case that's when the real learning happens.</p><p>That's what when you actually understand the concept is when you apply. Let's say if you try to explain a child what walking is like the child is like I don't know but if you show me what I'm doing with this two feet, two legs this is walking you're like Okay I know what walking is now is just when people move from one place to another with their two feet that's walking right. But but if you just put it into a definition of a dictionary it becomes weird, alien and not human. Okay so that's the one of the key foundations, the way I teach at iLoveCoding is I tell you the the new concept because you need to learn new concepts but you translate that into a practical example.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">Learning technique #5. That is then do not commit to memory. Anything that can be looked up in a book and that is a quote by Einstein and I live by it. And the thing is that there's so much to learn you. I'm gonna tell you just right now. Even after four years or three years or five years or probably seven years you're still going to be learning coding because coding is a long journey. It keeps on happening and you're gonna be a developer let's say in four months five months six months seven months one year whatever your timeline is you're going to become that developer you're gonna be professional you're gonna be proficient but you're gonna continue to learn so it's not that when you are learning you memorize all these concepts all what are arrays what are our functions what are the five different properties that are array has and stuff like that. All this this gibberish stuff you're not going to memorize use you do not have to memorize. Professional Developers are allowed to Google stuff and look up resources relook up their knowledge and refresh their knowledge on the job when they're doing it. So there is no requirement for you to memorize these things the way it is it's gonna be memorized is when you keep on doing it. When you keep on building these programs it's going to automatically the important stuff is going to automatically become habit. And the more or less you use to stuff is going to automatically be something in the back of your head and you can quickly Google it when the need comes</span></p><p>With that, I want to give you three fool tests that there are certain tests that I'm going to give you that's going to determine if you're making the progress in the correct direction.</p><p>So fool test number #1 is</p><p>\"If you did not code, You did not learn\"</p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">So a lot of time is going to happen is when you watch my videos you say hey you know. Oh yeah I understand this. It makes sense. Piece of cake. But my thing is if you did not copy my example to what I showed you then you have an illusion of learning. You actually did not learn. So back to the concept Number one I was copy example code. So when I show you certain code it's your job to follow along and copy those examples. If you did not code those examples then you merely have an illusion of learning and understanding that knowledge that understanding is gonna quickly fade away as not going to serve you. So if you did not code you did not learn.</span></p><p>Fool test #2 is \"If you did not ship, you did not build\".</p><p>So there is a very famous quote by Steve Jobs he said \"great artist ship\" or actually a \"real artist ship\". And what that really means is artist is somebody who creates OK a programmer is a creator a graphic designer is a creator an artist who draws is a creator author is a creator artist who acts on television or movies is an artist, right. So anybody who creates is an artist and shipping the concept of shipping means that when you launch something so them and you create your let's say you book or a blog or a program or a software or some painting you have to launch it to the world and if you do not launch it if you did not ship it then that means you'd never built it.</p><p>It's it's in your lab. That's your that's your experiment. So if you are if you did not ship if you did not launch your creations, if you do not launch your application if you'd not launch your code to the real world to github and add it to your portfolio that means you never built. So you have to make the the emphasis on when you create something it's not gonna be perfect. It's never going to be perfect. You're gonna keep every new creation you make is gonna be better but you gonna keep on improving that. So if you do not ship it that means you never built it. Okay?</p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">And full test #3 is \"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yourself\" And that's by Einstein and that is the concept that a lot of teachers of the in the coding world and maybe you have had some good teachers and bad teachers of different subjects. We all have right. Let's be honest about good teachers. We have had bad teachers throughout our our our life. And the good teachers have the ability to make things explain us things in a simple manner that's digestible for us. And the reason they're able to do that is because they actually have a core understanding of that particular concept. So it's my job to explain to you things simply. And if I did not explain it simply, that means that I did not do my job.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9rem;\">I maybe don't understand the concept myself. And it's then your job is to understand that concept on a clear manner so that you are able to explain it. And if you are able to explain that concept whatever the new concepts you're gonna learn in programming if you can explain it that means you understand it. If you cannot explain it that means you don't understand clearly enough. And that's very important for you because when you go to you to do your interviews you're going to be asked these questions like \"What is a call stack?\" thats it, point blank. The interviewer is going to just ask you a point a blank question. Question What is it called stack. \"How does it asynchronous functions work in JavaScript?\", \"What are promises?\" just like these point blank questions that you're you're thinking right now. Oh my God I don't know what this is but I'm gonna explain these things to you in a simple manner and you will have to practice to answer these things in a simple manner. So you are interview-ready and I'm gonna help you with that. So that's my three fool test that's gonna help you towards the direction of learning things correctly. So you become job-ready, interview-ready, resume-ready, portfolio-ready. That's pretty much it for this video. I want to talk to you in the next.</span></p>"

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage. There is no website or webpage on the internet that does not use HTML. Without HTML, the web would not be possible.</p>\n    \n<h3>What HTML is not</h3>\n<p>HTML is not a programming language. Please don't confuse the two concepts. A programming language has logical and computational capability to instruct a computer to do some operations. A markup language, on the other hand, is static and is only used to organize data in a specific structure. HTML in our case is used to give structure to a web page.</p>\n    \n<h2>What is CSS?</h2>\n<p>CSS stands for <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets. Think of it as the skin and clothing for the HTML webpage. CSS is simply a list of style properties that get applied to HTML elements. Just the way clothing is put onto a human body, similarly, CSS styling is applied on HTML elements. CSS enhances the colors, layout, and styling of the HTML webpage, making it look more beautiful and professional.</p>\n    \n\n<h2>Why learn HTML and CSS?</h2>\n<p>Unlike programming languages, HTML and CSS have NO competition. If you want to make web pages, start a career in web design, web development or even web journalism, the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is a must have.</p>\n    \n<p>Fortunately, the foundation of HTML and CSS are not that difficult. You can start getting comfortable with HTML in a matter of hours. Basic CSS is also not that difficult, however, CSS can get complicated when trying to build advanced layouts.</p>\n\n<p>This course, <a href=\"https://ilovecoding.org/courses/htmlcss2\">\"Learn HTML and CSS Correctly\"</a>, will hold your hand to teaching you the basics and advanced concepts of HTML and CSS, so you are comfortable building simple and advanced websites.</p>\n\n<h2>What can you build with HTML and CSS?</h2>\n<p>Any website layout! Yes, any. All, yes all websites use HTML and CSS, and once you get a hang of it, you can build websites as beautiful as Airbnb, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (You name it).</p>\n<p>Remember one thing! HTML and CSS will only help you build website layouts and static websites. The intelligent aspect of a webpage, such as a login capability, storing information in a database and advanced interactivity is built with a programming language such as JavaScript. Once you are comfortable with HTML and CSS&nbsp;and have built some projects, your next step is to <a href=\"https://ilovecoding.org/courses/js2\">learn JavaScript</a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>What resources should you refer when learning HTML and CSS</h2>\n<p>Take this course as you guide! For reference, I highly recommend the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference\">HTML reference on Mozilla</a>. They also have some really <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML\">good guides here</a>.</p>\n<p>Web Docs on Mozilla (MDN) is the most authentic and trusted source to lookup information on web technology - HTML, CSS and, JavaScript. Whenever I need more information on a topic, I google the following query <em>\"topic name mozilla\"</em>\n</p>\n<h2>What will you learn in this Free video course?</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Basic syntax of HTML</li>\n    <li>Common HTML Elements</li>\n    <li>Must have markup on every webpage</li>\n    <li>How to create headline, paragraph and lists</li>\n    <li>How to create forms elements - text fields, radio/checkbox buttons, select boxes</li>\n    <li>How to structure a webpage layout</li>\n    <li>What are semantic elements and why to use them</li>\n    <li>Basic syntax of CSS</li>\n    <li>Common CSS properties</li>\n    <li>CSS selectors and its type</li>\n    <li>Using CSS to enhance website layout</li>\n    <li>Importing files in your HTML document</li>\n    <li>Advanced positioning of elements with CSS</li>\n    <li>Adding custom fonts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What will you create with <em>Learn HTML &amp; CSS Correctly</em> video course?</h2>\n<p>The goal of this course is&nbsp;to give you practical, real-world examples so you are off to creating your vision.</p>\n<p>For that, you will create two finished projects</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center mb-2\"><img class=\"mx-auto shadow w-75\" src=\"https://a.ilovecoding.org/thumb/htmlcss2/blog-design.png\" alt=\"Blog Design Project\"><br><br>\n<img class=\"mx-auto shadow w-75\" src=\"https://a.ilovecoding.org/thumb/htmlcss2/coupon.png\" alt=\"Coupon with Positioning\"></p>\n\n<h2>How is the course organized?</h2>\n<p>The course is organized such that you watch the video and follow along. If you simply watch the video and do not apply your learning, you will have an illusion of learning. So its important that you download the right software tools suggested and follow the instructions.</p>\n<h2>How long will it take me to learn HTML and CSS?</h2>\n<p>It may take you 1-2 weeks to complete the course, and about a month of practice to get comfortable with HTML and CSS. The key is to apply your learning and build projects. The easiest project you can create is your own personal website. You need your own presence online. Social media profiles are not enough. You want your own website where you can express yourself and your skills. This course will give you all the skills to build that website.</p>\n<p>With more practice, you can start building websites for clients as well&nbsp;and start charging for your services.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Full Video Transcript</h2>\n<p>Do you want to build websites for yourself or for your clients? Then you must learn HTML and CSS.</p>\n<p>Welcome to the learn HTML and CSS in 14 days course on iLoveCoding. I'm happy that you're here because this is an awesome comprehensive and detailed course on how to build simple and professional websites with HTML and CSS.</p>\n<p>Now you may be asking what is HTML and CSS and why should you care. And why should you take this course? Those are awesome questions. You see HTML and CSS are two distinct coding languages used to make websites. The fact of the matter is that all websites are built with HTML and CSS and the Web would be impossible without it. Now, Yes! websites like Google.com, YouTube, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, you name it - Any website, all websites, big and small are built with HTML and CSS.</p>\n<p>HTML is used to put the structure of a website together and CSS is used to make your website look pretty with colors, styled and advanced layout. If you want to make websites even the most simplest websites or want to become a web designer, webmaster, or web developer, you must learn HTML and CSS. In fact, if you want to do anything with the tech or web world, I highly recommend you take this course because it's going to serve you well now and in the future of your career.</p>\n<p><b>Now let's see what you will be learning in this course:</b></p>\n<p>In this course you will learn what is HTML and CSS, what does it stand for. You will learn how to write simple websites and web pages using HTML and CSS. You will learn the basic syntax of HTML and how it's written. You will learn how to format your code like a professional. You will learn what tools to use and what tools not to use when coding. You will learn the basic terminologies used around the web world like \"tags\", \"elements\", \"attributes\" and you will get comfortable using these features and talking like in that particular lingo.</p>\n<p>You will learn how to see the code of other websites using a tool called Chrome developer tools so you can see how other websites are coded so you can get inspiration from them and code your websites and enhance your websites accordingly.</p>\n<p>You will learn how to make headlines titles, forms, tables, paragraphs. You will learn how to link your website with other websites or link the pages of your own websites together and you will learn everything in between on building these beautiful websites. You see an HTML consist of a lot of elements. I will share with you the most common elements that you must know about and then I will travel to you two trusted resources so you can look up more information whenever you need.</p>\n<p>Kind of like a cheat sheet. Once you have a gist of HTML, then I will share with you the basics of CSS and how to use it to make your website look pretty and professional. Something like this.</p>\n<p>Yes! we will be building this beautiful blog design together in this course. Plus, I will share with you some advance hacks that professional developers use. All in all, this course will give you the tools, training, resources, cheat sheets, and homework so you become comfortable in writing HTML and CSS, and building professional and beautiful looking websites. Remember one thing. The best way to learn is to manually hand copy the things that I teach you. So I recommend in this course that you watch the videos twice. The first time you watch it and ingest the concept and take notes and then the second time you watch it and then you copy along with me in your code editor and build what I am building. This way you will internalize and knowledge and you're going to learn by doing as well.</p>\n<p>Just imagine when you create your first website how proud will you be? if that excites you. Let's get started.</p>\n<p></p><p></p>",

The first is going to be a modern browser. I highly recommend that you <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">download Google Chrome</a> because probably it is the best browser out there. But more importantly, it comes with a very handy set of tools called the Chrome developer tools. So you can go to the menu > more tools, there is something called developer tools. We are going to use these toolsets throughout our course in the later stage. So that’s very important.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        The next thing you will need is a text editor or sometimes also called the code editor. This is a piece of software where you write your code. There are many code editors or text editors out there. The one I highly\n        recommend, we are going to be using in our course is called <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS\n            Code</a>, or for the full form, it is called Visual\n        Studio Code. It is by Microsoft. It is a free tool, and it’s pretty awesome. You don’t just use the VS Code for\n        HTML and CSS; you can use it to code different languages, e.g., C #, Python, JavaScript, and many others. It is available on Mac, Linux, and Windows, so you are all set for that.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        If you prefer a different code editor, there are many other options. Another good one is <a\n            href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a>. It is a\n        paid one. They have a free trial. There is another one by <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>. It is called\n        the <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom Editor</a>. Another one\n        which is a paid one, which is very popular as well is called <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\">Web\n            Storm</a>. You try out <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad ++</a> and <a\n            href=\"http://brackets.io/\">Brackets</a> as\n        well. But you need one of those code editors. They all work pretty well. But I like the VS Code. It is very\n        popular. So download Google Chrome and a text editor like VS Code, and I am going to talk to you in the next\n        lesson/video.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body>",

The thing is that when you are a new developer, and you download\n      this software called VS Code or any text editor, they come with a lot of\n      options, and it can be overwhelming. So in this video, I want to make you\n      comfortable with a code editor like VS Code. </p>\n    <p> Now I want to tell you that a text editor is actually a very fancy\n      software on the surface, but it is very simple in the background. The\n      number one reason we use a text editor is that because it has something\n      called <em>Syntax Highlighting</em>. </p>\n    <p> So let's say, if I go to the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS\n        Code website</a> and I go over here, you see some code has been written\n      here, and it has different colors. That means it automatically highlights\n      the code parts, so it is easier for the developer to read. You just write\n      the code and it automatically makes it into different colors. </p>\n    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://a.iLoveCoding.Org/img/htmlcss2/2-text-editor-overview/vs-code-syntax-highligthing.jpg\"\n\n      alt=\" Syntax Highlighting\">\n    <p> The second thing the text editor has, it has some <em>help text</em>.\n      So let’s say if you are writing certain code, it is going to give you the\n      different options that you can write along the way as you are typing. So\n      as you are typing something just like in Google. Let’s say you go to\n      Google.com. And you are doing a search, I write, 'make', and it just\n      gives/suggests to me these helpful texts. So that is another feature that\n      a text editor has. </p>\n    <p> So these are the two primary reasons we use a code editor, or else we\n      can write code in any kind of software. We do not have to have a code\n      editor. So that is the number one reason I want to tell you why we use a\n      code editor. </p>\n    <p> The second thing that I want to get you familiar with the VS Code is\n      that it has something called color themes. So if you select different\n      themes, you can change the color of how your code editor looks. I like to\n      stick with the default, so I am going to stick with my default colors. </p>\n    <p> Another thing I want to show you is that it has a lot of options here.\n      So, for the most part, we are going to be using just the Explorer section\n      over here when we have a lot of code, a lot of different files. It can\n      help us explore those files, just the way on our computer. Let us say I\n      create a folder over here. If I open this folder where I go to the <code>ilovecoding\n        video</code> folder, all these folders that we have, show those files. </p>\n    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://a.iLoveCoding.Org/img/htmlcss2/2-text-editor-overview/vscode-file-explorer.jpg\"\n\n      alt=\"File Explorer\">\n    <p> So let's say in a project I have this project folder. I create the\n      folders like <code>first-page</code> and I import drag and drop this over\n      here. It is going to basically show that in the <strong>Explorer</strong>\n      section, you see the <code><strong>FIRST-PAGE</strong></code> over here,\n      and now I can simply add files. So that is a <code>filea.js</code>, let's\n      say if you are making a JavaScript file and I can just right-click and do\n      the same thing, let's say <code>index.html</code>. And I can make more\n      files here. </p>\n    <p> So if I create these files over here and I open my folder, you will see\n      those files have been created in that particular project folder. So we\n      call this a project folder and we import or drag and drop this project\n      folder in our VS code and we can simply browse that over here. If you want\n      to organize that into folders, I can just create a folder over here. And I\n      can sub-organize these files if I want to drag this over here. I can just\n      move this particular file inside this folder. So if I go inside the\n      folder, you see this file. So basically, that is what a coder editor is.\n      It is just simply the syntax highlighting and stuff like that. </p>\n    <p> Now it has other advanced features as well, but it does not matter. The\n      point of the matter is that it is just a tool to facilitate a developer’s\n      job. And if it gets very overwhelming, just ignore those features. Just\n      like right now when I was playing around with this file, this particular\n      thing opened up. Do not worry about it. I am just going to close it, that\n      is all. We do not need it. </p>\n    <p> One more thing I want to tell you about the VS Code is that they are\n      constantly upgrading it. So if your VS Code looks slightly different,\n      maybe the colors are different. They\n      usually have a purple here. Do not worry about it. They are just\n      keeping on upgrading it. Some options, some icons just look different. I\n      have certain extensions installed. So extensions are over here. So you may\n      have a different extension preinstalled. I may have some different\n      extensions installed. That is why it looks slightly different. </p>\n    <p> But the fact of the matter is that you just focus on the code that is\n      being written, and you are going to be all fine. So with that said, let us\n      start in our next video by creating our first web page. Talk to you in the\n      next video. </p>\n  </body>"

In this video, we are going to create our first <strong>HTML</strong>\n      page. So let's get started. I am going to go on my desktop. Create a\n      folder, and I am just going to call it <code>my first</code> or <code>first-page</code>.\n      Alright, I am going to drag and drop this folder, and VS Code is going to\n      restart and put our folder over here.</p>\n    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://a.iLoveCoding.Org/img/htmlcss2/3-first-webpage/drag-and-drop.jpg\"\n\n      alt=\"Drag Folder in VS\">\n    <p>I am going to minimize this so I do not have to see all that different\n      text. So over here, I am going to create our first page. I am going to\n      call it anything. I can call it <code>home.html</code>. I can call it <code>aziz.html</code>,\n      and I can call it whatever. But for a standard for the web, the first page\n      of a website is always called<span style=\"font-family: monospace;\"> </span><strong><code>index</code></strong>,\n      so I am just going to call it <code>index.html</code>. </p>\n    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://a.iLoveCoding.Org/img/htmlcss2/3-first-webpage/create-first-page.jpg\"\n\n      alt=\" Create First Page\">\n    <p> Now, we are calling it <code>.html</code> because it is the extension\n      of that particular file. Just like in the world of computers, when you\n      create a file, which is a music file, you will have a <code>song.mp4</code>\n      or <code>mp3</code>. <code>mp3</code> is for audio, and <code>mp4</code>\n      is for videos. For word documents, it is <code>.docx</code>. There are\n      different extensions of the file that tell the computer that this is the\n      file format. Similarly, when we are creating our HTML page, the extension\n      for that page will be either <code>.htm</code> or <code>.html</code>.\n      These are the standard for an HTML file. </p>\n    <p> So, I just created my first file called <code>index.html</code>. Hit\n      enter and that file has been created. Now, VS Code has this handy feature\n      that I can actually zoom in. So if I do <strong>command + +</strong> or\n      just keep on doing <strong>+</strong>, it is actually going to zoom in.\n      So I am going just to zoom in so it is easier for you to see. And I have a\n      certain extension installed, so I am going to make it full screen, so it\n      is easier for you to read.</p>\n    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://a.iLoveCoding.Org/img/htmlcss2/3-first-webpage/zoom-in.jpg\"\n\n      alt=\"Zoom In\">\n    <p> I am going to close this welcome thing. Now, I am going to start writing\n      some code. Actually. I am not going to write some code. I am just going to\n      write some regular text. So I am going to say, ‘Hi, this is my first\n      website.’ Alright, save, and now I want to see this page. </p>\n    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://a.iLoveCoding.Org/img/htmlcss2/3-first-webpage/first-web-page.jpg\"\n\n      alt=\" First web page\">\n    <p> So, I am going to go to my <code>first-page</code> folder. This is my <code>index.html</code>\n      page, and I am simply going to open it in Google Chrome. So I am going to\n      drag and drop it. Or I can actually double-click it, as well. Alright, it\n      does not matter. So that is open. And you see that our first page has been\n      created. This is my first website. Now, I know this looks pretty simple,\n      but that is the point I want to tell you is that <em>HTML is a very\n        forgiving language!</em></p>\n    <p> That means that even when we did not write any HTML, this is just text,\n      and we open that file in the browser. The browser knows how to render\n      that, which simply said, \"okay, this is some text. I do not know how to\n      interpret it, and I am just going to throw it on the page.\" And that is\n      what it does.</p>\n    <p>I want to tell you is how to create your first web page, how to name the\n      extensions. And also, if you simply write some gibberish text and you keep\n      blabbering around. It is going to print it on the page. Simply save, and I\n      go over here, and I refresh. It is going to put it on the page. </p>\n    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://a.iLoveCoding.Org/img/htmlcss2/3-first-webpage/webpage-refresh.jpg\"\n\n      alt=\" First web page\">\n    <p> So with that said, you have simply created your first simple, little\n      website. If you want to launch a website, you can just say ‘Coming Soon’\n      and launch it on the Internet. So every time you save, you have to come\n      and refresh over here. And that is where you see your changes. So with\n      that, you have created your first little web page. But in the\n      next video, we are going to go official and start learning the actual HTML\n      language and its syntax. Talk to you in the next video. </p>\n  </body>\n\n"

So if you simply scroll down, that is the last rule, and that is that some elements do not have a closing tag but they are self-closing.</p>\n<p>The general rule for HTML elements is that they have a closing tag. But some exceptions like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, do not have closing tags and hence, do not have children elements.<br>They usually follow this format:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;name attribute=\"value\"/&gt;</code></p>\n<p>\tthe <q>/</q> denotes that it is a self-closing tag.</p> \n\n<h3>The &lt;br /&gt; tag</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag basically is a line-break (br stands for <em>break row</em>). If you want to have a space between 2 paragraphs for example, you need to use a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag. Just manually trying to do this by pressing enter won't have any results in your web page, the same works for multiple spaces. See this example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;p id=\"first-para\"&gt;\n  this is the text       for the paragraph.\n  &lt;span&gt;\n    this is some more text\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;\n    sadjalsdkjsa\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>The code above will result in this:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/thumb/htmlcss2/element-br-before.jpg\" class=\"border img-fluid\" alt=\"example before using <br /> element\">\n\n<p>We can clearly see that all the extra spacing and the new lines do not have any effect. For jumping to a new line we use the <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>. For this example, we want to start the span text in a new line, and have a blank line between them. So we add two <strong>br</strong> tags and the code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;p id=\"first-para\"&gt;\n  this is the text       for the paragraph.\n  &lt;br /&gt;\n  &lt;br /&gt;\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;span&gt;\n    this is some more text\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;\n    sadjalsdkjsa\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre> <img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/thumb/htmlcss2/element-br-after.jpg\" class=\"border img-fluid\" alt=\"example of <br /> element usage\">\n\n<p>As you can see in the example above, after we use the <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> the vertical spacing was applied.</p>\n\n<h3>The &lt;hr /&gt; tag</h3>\n\n<p>\tIf we want to define a line to separate content or to define a thematic break, we can use the <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code> tag, which stands for horizontal rule. It makes a horizontal line across the screen which is very useful to separate the content visually. Let's use it in our example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;p id=\"first-para\"&gt;\n  this is the text       for the paragraph.\n  &lt;br /&gt;\n  &lt;br /&gt;\n  &lt;hr /&gt;\n\n\n\n  &lt;span&gt;\n    this is some more text\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;\n    sadjalsdkjsa\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here we can see the result:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/thumb/htmlcss2/element-hr.jpg\" class=\"border img-fluid\" alt=\"example of <hr /> element usage\">\n\n<p>One last thing to know about HTML elements, is that one single element can have multiple attributes. like <code> &lt;img id=\"first-img\" class=\"myclass\" alt=\"my first image\" /&gt;</code>, but it won't have any effects visually since they are not meant for it. We will learn more about this in future lessons.</p>",

They are also collecting a lot of information and building a great reference of many things related to technology and web development, including <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and others as well.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/common-elements/mozilla-doc-website.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Interface of Mozilla documentation website\">\n\n<p>If you simply scroll down after accessing the page, you'll be able to see the different elements that you can use in HTML as displayed above. There is information about the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, and many others organized by different sections of usage.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, right now it may not make a lot of sense to you but as you finish the course all of this is going to make sense, and you can navigate through different explanations on the elements and have a pretty handy example of use of that element. But worry about it right now, it is just a reference that you can use it later.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/common-elements/viewing-article-element.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Viewing the article element as an example\">\n\n<p>After clicking any element that you want to know some information about, you'll be able to see the code of a very handy example of how to use that element, and what it's going to do.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element\">Mozilla HTML Reference</a> is a very handy resource that you should bookmark.</p>\n\n<p>One important rules I want to emphasis on is:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n    Do not want to commit to memory anything that can be looked up in a book.\n    <footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">\n        Albert Einstein\n    </footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...and this same concept applies for HTML and any other coding language that you are learning. You do not want to memorize these things. I have never memorized it. Whenever I want to look up something I simply google it, and look at the authentic sources just like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element\">Mozilla Documentation</a> or some other website depending on the technology that I'm looking into.</p>\n\n<h3>Stack Overflow</h3>\n<p>Another very handy resource to know about is <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a>. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> is a question and answer website for developers, and it's another great reference that you can use.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/common-elements/stackoverflow-link.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Link of Stackoverflow website\">\n\n<p>You can look for your questions directly in the search box of the website as shown above in the results, or you can google for <em>\"stackoverflow\"</em> and the question that you have.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say that you have a question about the HTML paragraph tag, this is how you should search on Google to see the results from Stack Overflow:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/common-elements/google-question-stackoverflow.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Googling for stackoverflow question\">\n\n<p>Do not attempt to memorize it, these concepts are automatically going to ingest in your brain the more you use it.

That means that if you break the syntax and if you write incorrect code let's say by avoiding the closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag and miss the closing <code>&lt;/span&gt;</code> tag, this is how it should look.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;p id=\"first-para\" class=\"info\"&gt;\n  This is the text          for the paragraph.\n  &lt;br /&gt;\n  &lt;br /&gt;\n  &lt;hr /&gt;\n\n\n\n  &lt;span id=\"whatever\" class=\"something else\"&gt;\n    this is some more text\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;\n    sadjalsdkjsa\n</pre> <img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/forgiving-lang/broken-html-example.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"result of a broken HTML code\">\n\n<p>Sometimes it is going to totally break, but sometimes is going to simply work. Right here I am missing the two closing tags, but still it's working.</p>\n\n<p>So that's what I want to mention to you, that HTML is a very forgiving language. That means that when the browser reads the code, it tries it's best to understand it. And even if it's broken, it's gonna try to make sense of it, and render something on the screen to the best of it's knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, I'm gonna right-click, and inspect the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. Basically you've learned that the inspect feature will open all the code in the elements tab in the <em>Chrome Developer Tools</em>, and you immediately see that this is not the code that we wrote.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/forgiving-lang/inspecting-broken-html.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"inspecting the broken HTML code\">\n\n<p>We never wrote the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, neither the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> elements, we just wrote the code that goes inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So where is the rest of the code coming from? And that is what goes on to say that HTML is a very forgiving language. The browser interprets our code and fills in the gaps to make the webpage appear on the screen. Now, this does not mean that it's okay to make mistakes. It only means that a lot of times you may have made a mistake and you will not see an error on the screen.</p>\n\n<h3>Proper format of an HTML document</h3>\n\n<p>Now you see that so far you wrote all of these HTML elements, and these are the elements that shows up on the page.</p>\n\n<p>But, the proper way to write an HTML page, is to have this particular basic markup.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      page title goes here\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    page content goes here\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>You write an &lt;html&gt; element, and inside it you have two elements: the &lt;head&gt;, and the &lt;body&gt; elements.</p>\n\n<h3>&lt;body&gt;</h3>\n\n<p>The &lt;body&gt; one, will have everything that is shown in this area:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/forgiving-lang/body-area.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Showing <body> area in the page\">\n\n<p>This white area is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of the HTML page.</p>\n\n<h3>&lt;head&gt;</h3>\n\n<p>in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area, you write let's say the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. This is just one option, there are many others as well, but this is one of the thing that you write in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.</p>\n\n<p>What is <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>? It is the section which is like the options for the web page.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/forgiving-lang/page-title.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"showing the title of the page\">\n\n<p>Where it says \"<em>index.html</em>\", you want to mention the title for that page, so you're going to put it inside the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, and everything that you want to show <strong>inside</strong> that particular page, will go inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> area.</p>\n\n<h3>Explaining the code from the inspector</h3>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/forgiving-lang/viewing-inspector-code.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"seeing the code from the inspector\">\n\n<p>Now with that said, you can see over here that the browser is smart enough to think \"hey, these are some <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, it looks like they fit inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> area\". So it just puts it automatically inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. Smart enough, right?</p>\n\n<p>Even though HTML is a forgiving language, if you break the rules too much, your code will not work in the way that you expect. So always be careful writing code, indent your code pretty well so it is easier for you to read, so you can have the proper result that you are expecting.</p>With that said, in the next lesson, we are going to go over this basic markup, and you're going to know basically the things that you need to know about HTML to get started. In the rest of the tutorials we are going to be focusing on the different elements one by one, and after that, we are going to get into the CSS.<p></p>\n\n<p>So that's pretty much it for this lesson, I'll talk to you in the next.</p>"

So we are going to start off by typing the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. Basically, the <em>DOCTYPE</em> tells the browser that \"Hey browser, process my HTML with the latest version of HTML, which is HTML5\". So the browser knows whatever code it read, it's going to be read the latest format.</p>\n\n<p>HTML has multiple versions and subversions, but the latest one is now HTML5. So basically if you have an older website, it's going to have a different number version mentioned in the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code>. But since HTML5 is very common now, we are going to use it with the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> and it will tell the browser to use the latest version.</p>\n\n<p>So let's remove our previous code and write this particular element.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Before we move further, notice that this is a very special element, it does not have a <em>/</em> (slash) for closing the element, and it also has an <code>!</code> (exclamation point) at the beginning. This is an unique exception, there is no other element like such in HTML. With that said, let's start with our normal HTML now.</p>\n\n<h3>The Basics</h3>\n\n<p>So we start off putting our <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element first, with a <strong>mandatory</strong> attribute called <code>lang</code>. \"lang\" stands for <strong>language</strong>, which is the language that this HTML document is written in. For this value we put <em>\"en\"</em>, for English.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n    \n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Similarly when there is an opening tag, it will always have a closing tag, which is <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. And inside this HTML we need two children only, nothing else. These are the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>The &lt;title&gt; element</h3>\n\n<p>As you already know from our previous lesson, whatever the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element has inside, will show up on the page, and anything inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> are basically options for that entire web page.</p>\n\n<p>One important element for an HTML document, is the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. In this element we define the title of this page, so let's say that my page title is \"This is my first page\".</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n        \n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>This is the result:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/basic-markup/title-element-usage.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"usage of <title> element\">\n\n<p>Notice that what we exactly wrote in the code shows up in the title area.</p>\n\n<p>This area is very important. Let's say if you Google \"<em>anything here</em>\".</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/basic-markup/google-search-for-title.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"searching on Google a random text to check the title of the page\">\n\n<p>Over here you can see that the description for one of the Google results is <em>\"Scratch Studio - add anything here!\"</em>.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/basic-markup/page-title.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"The title of the page from the google results\">\n\n<p>If you go to that page, you can see that <em>\"Scratch Studio - add anything here!\"</em> is actually the <strong>title</strong> of that page. It's not mentioned anywhere else on the page and there is no other text like such, it's only in that section shown above.</p>\n\n<p>Search engines put a lot of emphasis on what the title of the page is. And whatever it is, it's going to show up in the search engines per page. So every HTMl page is treated separately by your web servers, and also Google.</p>\n\n<p>Google does not index web sites, it actually indexes pages, one at the time. So you want to make sure that your title is very relevant, when you are writing HTML pages.</p>\n\n<h3>Elements inside the &lt;body&gt;</h3>\n\n<p>Moving further, let's make two paragraphs inside our <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. For this we simply use the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, and write some text between them, like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Hi this is my first para\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      this is the second para\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>The result looks like this:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/basic-markup/p-element-usage.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border\" alt=\"usage of <p> element\">\n\n<p>And you can see that the first and second paragraphs are created.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that there is a natural space in between the paragraphs, and the reason is that when you are wrapping multiple elements with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> separately, the paragraph element is going to create a natural space.</p>\n\n<p>Different elements have different attributes, and they treat the content differently. That's why we have multiple elements, and they all treat the content slightly differently.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, we have completed most of the understanding of how HTML works and it's basic elements. You learned what the name of the page should be, how to write elements, what the basic markup of the content should be, and now the rest are just details which we will cover one at the time and create beautiful pages.</p>\n\n<p>I will talk to you in the next lesson.</p>",

Now things are going to get easier, because now we only need to look at the different elements that we have. We will be covering 4 elements in this lesson, and then we will be looking at the rest.</p>\n\n<h3>From &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</h3>\n\n<p>One of the very important elements in HTML is the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> all the way to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> elements. <strong>h1</strong> stands for header one, so it's the main header for a page. For example if you are reading a book, the main title for that particular chapter, consider that to be <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, and a sub header could be an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and so on uptill <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>. Say that I am writing an \"about me\" page:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Hi my name is Aziz\n    &lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Hi this is my first para\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      this is the second para\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>And as result:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/h1-6-i-strong/h1-element-usage.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"usage of the <h1> element\">\n\n<p>By doing that, you can see automatically that just because I mentioned <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, it is a very big text.</p>\n\n<p>Now if I want to write a sub-header, that's going to be <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>. So we can simply put it under the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Hi my name is Aziz\n    &lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;\n    This is my bio page\n    &lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Hi this is my first para\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      this is the second para\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre> <img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/h1-6-i-strong/h2-element-usage.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"usage of the <h2> element\">\n\n<p>And you can see that the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> text is slightly smaller, and I can do the same thing all the way from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> which are valid tags in HTML.</p>\n\n<p>I am gonna simply replicate this code, so for this you can do <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd> for duplicating the lines, so I can simply rename them.</p>\n\n<p>There is another handy shortcut in <em>Visual Studio Code</em>. I can simply select some text and do <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> on Windows), and it's going to select both tag names for example. Let me show you what I mean:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/h1-6-i-strong/vs-shortcut-example.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid w-75\" alt=\"example of usage of the 'command' + 'D' shortcut\">\n\n<p>This way I can simply edit both of them together, like such:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/h1-6-i-strong/editing-tags.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid w-75\" alt=\"editing the tags with the help of the 'command' + 'D' shortcut\">\n\n<p>Pretty handy, right? And that's the beauty of a good text editor. Others are good as well: <strong>Sublime Text</strong> introduced, I believe, this particular shortcut, and <em>Visual Studio Code</em> has copied that.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/h1-6-i-strong/h1-to-h6.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Using all the 6 heading tags\">\n\n<p>If you save and refresh, you will see all our headings from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>. These are different tags, with different automatic formatting of the text and it's sizes.</p>\n\n<p>That's very handy when you are writing multiple content, you can format them differently.</p>\n\n<h3>The &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;i&gt; elements</h3>\n\n<p>Next, let's see if you want to make your text <em>italic</em> or <strong>bold</strong>, you are going to use the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> or the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say that you have the following two paragraphs in your code:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;\n      Hi my name is Aziz &lt;\n     /h1&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;\n      This is my bio page\n    &lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Hi this is my first para\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      this is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; para\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>For this, we want to make the word \"<em>second</em>\" from the second paragraph italic.</p>\n\n<p>So for this we simply put the word <em>second</em> inside the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/h1-6-i-strong/i-element-usage.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"example of usage of the <i> element\">\n\n<p>Save, refresh, and you will see that this is italic now.</p>\n\n<p>If we want to make the word \"<em>first</em>\" from the first paragraph bold, we can simply wrap the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element around it.</p>This is our code so far: <pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:15\">&lt;p&gt;\n  Hi this is my &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; para\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  this is the &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; para\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre> <img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/h1-6-i-strong/strong-and-i.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"using <strong> and <i> elements\">\n\n<p>Save, refresh, and you will see that the word \"first\" is now bold.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you want to make the word \"<em>this</em>\" italic and bold, you can use <strong>both</strong> of these elements.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:15\">&lt;p&gt;\n  Hi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is my &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; para\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  this is the &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; para\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre> <img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/h1-6-i-strong/using-both-strong-and-i.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Using both <strong> and <i> elements at the same time\">\n\n<p>You can see that this is bold, and also italic. So notice the way I am doing this; the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is the outer element, and inside there is a nested <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element, and inside it we have the child for the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, which is the word \"this\".</p>\n\n<p class=\"alert alert-info\">This particular format that I am doing is very important. HTML is very hierarchical, so it's <strong>nested</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course one element can have multiple children, for example if I have some text like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:15\">&lt;p&gt;\n  Hi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; something else &lt;/strong&gt; is my &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; para\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  this is the &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; para\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre>\n  \n<p>you will notice that the <strong>\"something else\"</strong> is bold, but only the <strong><i>\"this\"</i></strong> is italic and bold.</p>\n\n<p>It may be very difficult for you to read right now what code I wrote, that's why formatting the code comes in very handy, so I am just going to format this with the <strong>indent</strong> format.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:15\">&lt;p&gt;\n  Hi\n  &lt;strong&gt;\n    &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;\n    something else\n  &lt;/strong&gt; is my &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; para\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  this is the &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; para\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>You see, now it's more obvious, so that's how you do it.</p>\n\n<p>In the next lesson we are going to learn more about the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>elements. Now you already know about <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I will talk to you in the next lesson.</p>\n",

This is used basically to link one page to another, so let's do that.</p>\n\n<h3>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> Anchor Element</h3>\n\n<p>So over here I am going to simply remove a lot of the previous code we did, so our page is simple. It's easier for us to read the code.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to simply create an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, and inside I am going to put some text as children. For the text I am gonna to say \"Click me please\".</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Hi My name is Aziz&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Click me please&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Now you notice that when I created this element, <em>VS Code</em> automatically pre-populated this particular attribute called <code>href</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now basically what happens is that whenever some user clicks on this particular text, this page is going to go to whatever is mentioned in the <code>href</code> attribute.</p>\n\n<p>So let's say if you want to go to <em>Google.com</em>, you are going to simply put \"https://www.google.com\" as a value of the <code>href</code> attributre like such:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Hi My name is Aziz&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com\"&gt;Click me please&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Save, refresh, and you see that the link is over here.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/linking-a/a-element-usage.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Example of usage of the <a> element\">\n\n<p>Now if I hover over the text, I will see on my footer that it says the link, which is <em>google.com</em>. When you click the link, you will see the loading sign, and now it goes to <em>google.com</em>.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/linking-a/clicking-a-element.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Result after clicking the <a> element\">\n\n<p>Simple as that.</p>\n\n<h3>The <code>target</code> Attribute</h3>\n\n<p>Now this element has multiple options; let's say if I want to open this particular URL a new tab or a new window, not the same page. There is an option for that, which is called <code>target</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So I do <code>target=\"\"</code>, and the value you want to provide is <code>_blank</code>, like such:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Hi My name is Aziz&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com\"&gt;Click me please&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Now when you do that you refresh, and when you click the link you will see that it opens in a new tab.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/linking-a/after-click-target-attr.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Result after clicking the <a> element with the '_blank' value for the target\">\n\n<p>This is very handy. Let's say if you have a web site, and you want to link to external pages for example <strong>Google</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So let's say you are on your home page which is your personal web site, and you want to link to an external page; that is when this thing comes handy, and you do not want people to leave your web site.</p>\n\n<p>This is actually not a good practice to make all these links like that, but it's an option you have.</p>\n\n<h3>Internal Links</h3>\n\n<p>Now one more thing that I want to tell you, is that you cannot just link from the element to external pages, but it can also be internal pages of your web site.</p>\n\n<p>So let's say I am going to create a new page inside our web site. I am going to just simply create an <em>about</em> page. I am going to simply write some basic HTML.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to basically just copy the previous code from (<em>index.html</em>) and paste it in our <em>about</em> page. The title is going to be <em>\"about\"</em>, and I am going to put an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> with the text <em>\"this is my about page\"</em>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      About\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;This is my about page&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>And now if I want to link from the home page to the about one, I can simply create another link.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to mention the name of that location where this particular page lives. So since this page called <em>about</em> and it's in the same directory as the <em>index</em> page, I can simply put in <em>about.html</em>, and for the text I can say <em>\"Go to about\"</em>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      About\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;This is my about page&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n    &lt;a href=\"about.html\"&gt;Go to about&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Save, refresh, and now you see that link is over here.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/linking-a/internally-linking-pages.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Internally linking pages with the <a> element\">\n\n<p>Now, if I click this link it'll go to the <em>About</em> page, and from the <em>About</em> page we need to go back to the <em>Home</em> page.</p>\n\n<p>So I am going to create a link that directs to <em>\"index.html\"</em>, and for the text I am going to say <em>\"Go to home\"</em>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      About\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;This is my about page&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"index.html\"&gt;Go to home&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n  \n<p>Save, refresh, and now <em>\"Go to home\"</em> goes over here:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/linking-a/go-to-home.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Anchor link from the 'about' to the 'home' page\">\n\n<p>So that's pretty much it for this video about linking via the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, and now in the next video I am going to tell you a little bit more about this <code>href</code> linking strategy.</p>\n\n<p>All right, I am going to talk to you in the next video.</p>",

So let's suppose that there is an <strong>About</strong>, and a <strong>Portfolio</strong> page, there is a sub portfolio, and there are projects.</p>\n\n<p>There is so much going on, what should you do? You should organize your pages inside <strong>folders</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You are going to create a folder called <strong>projects</strong>. Let's say you want to display projects of yours to different people right?</p>\n\n<p>So inside \"projects\" I am just going to create a folder, and you have multiple pages for these projects. So let's name a file \"<em>clienta.html</em>\" for client A information, \"<em>clientb.html</em>\" for a different client, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>Code for <code>clienta.html</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      Client A\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Client A&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"index.html\"&gt;Go to home&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Code for <code>clienta.html</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      Client B\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Client B&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"index.html\"&gt;Go to home&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>You have these two pages, but we want to link to these pages, let's say from the home page. So I am going to go to the home page, and what do we do to link it to pages which are inside a folder?</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;  \n    &lt;title&gt;\n      Client B  \n    &lt;/title&gt;  \n  &lt;/head&gt;  \n  &lt;body&gt;  \n    &lt;h1&gt;Hi My name is Aziz&lt;/h1&gt;  \n    &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com\"&gt;Click me please&lt;/a&gt; \n\n    &lt;a href=\"about.html\"&gt;Go to about&lt;/a&gt;  \n    &lt;a href=\"clienta.html\"&gt;Go to Client A&lt;/a&gt;  \n    &lt;a href=\"clientb.html\"&gt;Go to Client B&lt;/a&gt;  \n  &lt;/body&gt;  \n&lt;/html&gt;  \n</pre>\n\n<p>So for the text of the link we can simply put in \"Client A\" and \"Client B\", and for the <code>href</code> we can put <code>clienta.html</code>, and <code>clientb.html</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's see what happens when I refresh:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/relative-path/relative-link.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Using a relative anchor link\">\n\n<p>When I click over here, it says \"<em>Your file was not found</em>\".</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/relative-path/relative-path-error.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Error using relative path\">\n\n<p>And the reason for that is because when you are linking files or pages, you want to mention the <strong>location</strong> of that particular file, <strong>relative</strong> to the page you are on.</p>\n\n<p>Now what does that mean? That means that this page <em>index.html</em> and all the other files, are <strong>inside</strong> this <em>first-page</em> folder.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/relative-path/files.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid w-75\" alt=\"All the files inside the 'first-page' folder\">\n\n<p>Right now if you want to link from the <em>index.html</em> to the <em>projects</em> folder and inside it the <em>clienta.html</em> file. You want to mention that from this <em>index.html</em> page go to the projects folder, \"<em>/</em>\" (slash) inside the <em>clienta.html</em>. Like such:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:12\"> \n    &lt;a href=\"about.html\"&gt;Go to about&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"projects/clienta.html\"&gt;Go to Client A&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"projects/clientb.html\"&gt;Go to Client B&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Just do the same thing for \"Client B\", and now let's see if it works.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/relative-path/correct-relative-path.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"result after clicking a correct relative link\">\n\n<p>And you see \"Client A\" shows up.</p>\n\n<h3>Going back from a sub-folder</h3>\n\n<p>Now the next thing that I want to tell you, is if from <em>clienta.html</em> which is a sub page, you want to go \"up\" a level and go back to <em>index.html</em>. How do you do that?</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:9\">    &lt;h1&gt;Client B&lt;/h1&gt;  \n    &lt;a href=\"index.html\"&gt;Go to home&lt;/a&gt;  \n  &lt;/body&gt;  \n&lt;/html&gt;  \n</pre>\n\n<p>This link is not going to work, because it actually says to go to <em>index.html</em>. So from this page which is <em>clientb.html</em>, relative from this, you want to go up one folder, to the <em>first-page</em> folder and inside it, the <em>index.html</em> is there.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>So if you want to go up one folder, you always do <em>../</em> (dot, dot, and slash).</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:9\">    &lt;h1&gt;Client B&lt;/h1&gt;  \n    &lt;a href=\"../index.html\"&gt;Go to home&lt;/a&gt;  \n  &lt;/body&gt;  \n&lt;/html&gt;  \n</pre>\n\n<p>That tells you ok, wherever you are from, in our case <em>clientb.html</em>, go not in this folder, but up one folder.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/relative-path/folder-structure.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"showing the structure of the project pages\">\n\n<p>So as you can see folder structure, that's our application.</p>\n\n<p>So if I save, and I do the same thing in <em>Client A</em> as well because it's in a sub-folder.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:9\">    &lt;h1&gt;Client A&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"../index.html\"&gt;Go to home&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>And now if I click over here it's actually going to go up one folder to the right location of <em>index.html</em>. So that's how you link via the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element.</p>\n\n<h3>The difference between Relative and Absolute path</h3>\n\n<p>The URLs which are relative to a particular location, are called <strong>relative</strong> paths.</p>\n\n<p>The links which are directly going to a particular location like this particular URL: <code>&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com\"&gt;Click me please&lt;/a&gt;</code> is not relative.</p>\n\n<p>These are called <strong>absolute</strong> paths, because they have the absolute location to an URL.</p>\n\n<p>So let's say if you want to link to <em>iLoveCoding</em>, and to a sub-page like this: <code>&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ilovecoding.com/pages/about.html\"&gt;Click me please&lt;/a&gt;</code>\n</p>\n\n<p>This is an <strong>absolute</strong> path&nbsp;because this has the absolute location where you want to go, it's not a relative location.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:12\"> \n    &lt;a href=\"about.html\"&gt;Go to about&lt;/a&gt;  \n    &lt;a href=\"projects/clienta.html\"&gt;Go to Client A&lt;/a&gt;  \n    &lt;a href=\"projects/clientb.html\"&gt;Go to Client B&lt;/a&gt;   \n</pre>\n\n<p>The above are relative locations. Now the browser is smart enough to distinguish between absolute and relative paths. Paths that start with <code>http</code>, or <code>https</code> are absolute paths, everything else is treated as a relative path.</p>\n\n<p>All right. so that's pretty much it for this video, I am going to talk to you in the next.</p>"

It has no special properties but one. Let's take a look at it right now.</p>\n\n<p>So we are in our web page, and let's say I am making a web page for myself, and I want to organize this web page in different sections.</p>\n\n<p>So let's say I have a section for my background, one for my professional life, and one section for my personal life and underneath each of these sections I may have multiple paragraphs, and some text about each of these sections.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Hi My name is Aziz&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;sadjalsdjlkds&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Professional&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;sdjalsdjlkjds&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Personal&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;sdjalsdjlkjds&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>When I save and refresh, I see this:</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/div-span/sections-example.jpeg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"creating multiple sections without div\">\n\n<p>Now if you look at the code, the code is not easy to read. It's not organized, so we need to make organize each of these sections separately.</p>\n\n<p>To do that, we are going to put each of sections inside their own <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, so here's how you do that. I am going to take the following code:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:12\">    &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;sadjalsdjlkds&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt; \n</pre>\n\n<p>The above section (the background and the paragraphs) and wrap it inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. Like such:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:10\">    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;sadjalsdjlkds&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>So now the two benefits are that it's easier to read because I know this is one section, and I am going to do the same thing over here for the second and third sections as well:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n      This is my first page\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Hi My name is Aziz&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;sadjalsdjlkds&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;Professional&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;sadjalsdjlkds&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;Personal&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;sadjalsdjlkds&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Each one of these are now individual sections.</p>\n\n<p>The significance of organizing this in a section, is not for readability; it's actually when we get to the CSS section of our website or of this course, we are going to see that when we have these sections we can actually use the CSS techniques to actually have advanced layouts.</p>\n\n<p>So if I save this and refresh, it's going to have no difference because <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a generic element, I have already told you it's just a generic container.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/div-span/before-inspecting-h2.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"results before we inspect the <h2> element\">\n\n<p>Just to show you what is happening in the background, when I am right-click on the word \"Background\" and click \"Inspect\", it's actually going to open the \"Developer tools\" and highlight this particular element (The element of the word \"Background\").</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/div-span/after-inspecting-h2.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"results after we inspect the <h2> element\">\n\n<p>You will see the background element is highlighted, and all of it's different spacing has been highlighted as well when I hover right there.</p>\n\n<p>So if I click over here, you will see that this entire blue area is highlighted, because this div element has all of these three things inside.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/div-span/inspecting-div.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Inspecting the <div> element\">\n\n<h3>The Special Property of &lt;div&gt;</h3>\n\n<p>Now one more thing, is that the special property of a div element, is that it takes up all the horizontal real estate that it can find, so it takes up all of this space.</p>\n\n<p>It does not let the second \"Professional\" <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to be on the right hand side; it's actually blocking the entire right hand side.</p>\n\n<p>So that's why it's actually containing all of it's information, and taking up all the horizontal real estate.</p>\n\n<p>So that is the property of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element; not just organizing things in a container, but also taking up all the horizontal real estate.</p>\n\n<p>Now this will become again very powerful and helpful when we get to the CSS section, where we can do advanced layout.</p>\n\n<p>So until then wait along and just think of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element as just a generic container.</p>\n\n<h3>The &lt;span&gt; Element</h3>\n\n<p>Now a close brother to the div element, is actually the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is also used as a generic container, but the difference is that where the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element takes up all the horizontal real estate, the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element only takes up the space that it needs.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element is typically used within a paragraph. Let's say I have a big paragraph over here in the background section.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:10\">    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        sadjalsdjlkds sadjalsdjlkds\n        sadjalsdjlkds sadjalsdjlkds\n        sadjalsdjlkds sadjalsdjlkds\n        sadjalsdjlkds sadjalsdjlkds\n\n        special text\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Let's say there is some \"special text\" over here, and we want to give it some some special attention.</p>\n\n<p>So what are we going to do is we are going to wrap in this particular \"special text\" inside the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element like such:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint precode linenums:10\">    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        sadjalsdjlkds sadjalsdjlkds\n        sadjalsdjlkds sadjalsdjlkds\n        sadjalsdjlkds sadjalsdjlkds\n        sadjalsdjlkds sadjalsdjlkds\n        &lt;span&gt;special text&lt;/span&gt;\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;skdjalsdkjasldj&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Save, refresh, and you see all of this text is here, but this \"special text\" is like within the same line, It's actually not taking up all the horizontal space.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/div-span/special-text.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"showing the special text within the paragraph\">\n\n<p>So just to prove the point there can be more text over here, I can just put some more text after it.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/div-span/text-after-special-text.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"showing some text after the special text\">\n\n<p>And you see the rest of the text is over here, and the \"special text\" just does not expand it's limits, it only takes up the space it needs.</p>\n\n<p>And just to prove that point, I can right-click and inspect, and you see the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element gets highlighted just to show that this element is taking up this much space.</p>\n\n<img src=\"//a.ilovecoding.org/img/htmlcss2/div-span/inspecting-span.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid border w-75\" alt=\"Inspecting the <span> element\">\n\n<p>Now the significance of the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element will also become very evident to you when we get to the CSS section.</p>\n\n<p>Until then you just know that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements are generic containers; <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> takes up all the horizontal speed real-estate that it has, and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> only takes up space inline within the line space that it needs.</p>\n\n<p>Until then, I will talk to you in the next lesson.</p>",
