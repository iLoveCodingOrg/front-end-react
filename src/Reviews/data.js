I found Aziz, joined iLC and wow, within weeks I was writing pure JS from scratch, using jQuery to build animations and even using API\'s. Best of all, I understood/understand it! Aziz has a unique way of teaching/explaining. It\'s hard to put into words actually. He boils it down so you understand it then shows you how to apply it. After every lesson you build something actually useful. As in, real life useful. If you have done other JS courses before & felt confused & felt maybe its not for you....give Aziz a shot! He\'ll have you confident in no time. Since doing iLC course I\'ve hired a team of full stack JS developers and it\'s been so awesome to be able to understand what they\'re doing, all thanks to Aziz.',

These past resources made it seem like I was learning but when I was on my own I realized that none of the information stuck or sank in. I think a majority of people give up at this point, however, I continued and kept failing miserably with subpar coding classes online. When I began iLoveCoding, I adapted to Aziz\'s teaching style almost instantly. I finally figured out that learning to code isn\'t about learning specific technologies ("Build a React app in 15 minutes" or "Build a full stack MERN app" were some previous videos I\'d watch) but instead, learning the basics, upon which we can add more knowledge. This may sound nothing at first, but it is absolutely necessary if you want to become someone skilled enough at programming to create the idea that\'s been in the back of your head for a year. The price seems to be a bit expensive, but it is worth paying. I wish Aziz will have lifetime membership subscription instead of monthly/Yearly',

Aziz creates a map for you and in his one-on-one call he gives you a very good idea which path you need to choose to get to your goals. I\'ve learned from iLoveCoding what I need to do and learn to successfully create the project that I want to run. iLoveCoding showing me the path, Making me think outside the box. It has great tips and tricks in courses and making me go from being completely lost to having realistic goals and plans set in place. I have membership in other sites but they use different teachers for different courses. Aziz teaches you how to get rid of the clutter and not get stuck on little things. I can\'t emphasize how important that lesson was to me.  As a perfectionist I thought the more I learn about one course the more it\'s going to help me, but after watching iLoveCoding courses, I realized not to spend too much time on stuff that I can easily look up.',
