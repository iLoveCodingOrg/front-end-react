I found Aziz, joined iLC and wow, within weeks I was writing pure JS from scratch, using jQuery to build animations and even using API\'s. Best of all, I understood/understand it! Aziz has a unique way of teaching/explaining. It\'s hard to put into words actually. He boils it down so you understand it then shows you how to apply it. After every lesson you build something actually useful. As in, real life useful. If you have done other JS courses before & felt confused & felt maybe its not for you....give Aziz a shot! He\'ll have you confident in no time. Since doing iLC course I\'ve hired a team of full stack JS developers and it\'s been so awesome to be able to understand what they\'re doing, all thanks to Aziz.',

I graduated from school with a Political Science degree, not a Computer Science degree ‚Äì Aziz has a skill that communicates coding to those without the formal education in the arena. Killer course for those wanting to learn JavaScript the right way.',

    body: 'Before I tried iLoveCoding, I spent almost a year trying countless resources to learn to code. These past resources made it seem like I was learning but when I was on my own I realized that none of the information stuck or sank in. I think a majority of people give up at this point, however, I continued and kept failing miserably with subpar coding classes online. When I began iLoveCoding, I adapted to Aziz\'s teaching style almost instantly. I finally figured out that learning to code isn\'t about learning specific technologies ("Build a React app in 15 minutes" or "Build a full stack MERN app" were some previous videos I\'d watch) but instead, learning the basics, upon which we can add more knowledge. This may sound nothing at first, but it is absolutely necessary if you want to become someone skilled enough at programming to create the idea that\'s been in the back of your head for a year. The price seems to be a bit expensive, but it is worth paying. I wish Aziz will have lifetime membership subscription instead of monthly/Yearly',
