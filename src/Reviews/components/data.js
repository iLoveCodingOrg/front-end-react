That’s what you get on this site. He’s articulate, doesn’t assume you’re coming in knowing anything, and builds your knowledge from the ground up.',

      body: 'I did a PHP course on udemy & found the language very easy. I did 2x courses on JavaScript via udemy and honestly, really had zero idea about JS at the end of them. I found Aziz, joined iLC and wow, within weeks I was writing pure JS from scratch, using jQuery to build animations and even using API\'s. Best of all, I understood/understand it! Aziz has a unique way of teaching/explaining. It\'s hard to put into words actually. He boils it down so you understand it then shows you how to apply it. After every lesson you build something actually useful. As in, real life useful. If you have done other JS courses before & felt confused & felt maybe its not for you....give Aziz a shot! He\'ll have you confident in no time. Since doing iLC course I\'ve hired a team of full stack JS developers and it\'s been so awesome to be able to understand what they\'re doing, all thanks to Aziz.',

Coming from a front-end coding / marketing / designer perspective, my JavaScript skills have grown leaps and bounds in these last 2 months. I graduated from school with a Political Science degree, not a Computer Science degree – Aziz has a skill that communicates coding to those without the formal education in the arena. Killer course for those wanting to learn JavaScript the right way.',
