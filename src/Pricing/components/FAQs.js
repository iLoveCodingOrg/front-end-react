                        I am glad you asked, I like solid, straight-up questions. iLoveCoding Front-End Development Program is more than just a video training program. It has three distinct and critical components which maximize your chances of success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        iLoveCoding Front-End Development Program =
                        Right Training + Learning Methodology + Mentorship
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other training provide you too much or too little information. This can cause overwhelm or confusion. iLoveCoding is different. iLoveCoding provides a linear, structured and proven path to incrementally build your fundamental knowledge of web development. With every lesson you learn small but critical skills that make you a better developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have access to a mentor via email(for Front-End Classic students) and via email and live calls (for Front-End Plus students). Whenever you get stuck or confused ping us, and we'll get you back on track of success.
